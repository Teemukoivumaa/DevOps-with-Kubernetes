# Exercise 5.04: Platform comparison

I chose Rancher because I have used it before:
- It's open source
- Is the market leader in open source native Kubernetes management
- Installation of Rancher is very easy and quick, all you need is to have Docker installed
- They offer free online meetups to learn how to use Rancher to easily deploy and manage Kubernetes
- It supports tools that DevOps teams use: Jenkins, Gitlab or Travis
- It allows you to manage any cluster and multiple clusters, not just Rancher created clusters
